# CS-255

  In the DriverPass project the client was Liam, the owner of DriverPass, a company designed to assist new drivers in working towards passing their road test.  DriverPass wanted to design a system to provide their users with online practice tests and courses as well as give their users the option to make in-person lessons with instructors with DriverPass.  If I had to revise any of my work on the DriverPass projects, I think I would revise the UML diagrams on the systems design document.  I would like to improve the quality of the UML diagrams overall and add more detail to better articulate the planned design for the DriverPass system.  It is important to consider the user's needs when designing system because the system is being made to serve a purpose to the user.  By keeping the user in mind when designing, systems can be designed to provide a positive experience to the user, so that they continue to use the system.  I interpreted the user's needs by reading the interview transcript provided to understand the purpose of the system to better understand what the users would want to get out of the experience and how to design around that experience.
