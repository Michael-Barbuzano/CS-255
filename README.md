# CS-255
  In the DriverPass project the client was Liam, the owner of DriverPass, a company designed to assist new drivers in working towards passing their road test.  DriverPass wants to provide their users with online practice tests and courses as well as give their users the option to make in-person lessons with instructors with DriverPass.  To do this, DriverPass wanted me to design a cloud-based system.  If I had to revise any of my work on the DriverPass projects, I think I would revise the UML diagrams on the systems design document.  I would like to improve the quality of the UML diagrams overall and add more detail to better articulate the planned design for the DriverPass system.
